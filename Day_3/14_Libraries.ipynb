Type \"conda-forge\" in the new line that appears in the dialog box, then press enter. Finally press the green \"Update channels\" button in the bottom right-hand corner.\n",
    "5. Use the \"Search Package\" text box to enter \"fuzzywuzzy\" and press enter.\n",
    "6. Select the checkbox next to the fuzzywuzzy package (library) name that appears in the list below.\n",
    "7. Click the green \"Apply\" button in the bottom right-hand corner. This will open up a dialog box that says \"Install Packages\". It will say \"Solving package specifications\" with a blue progress bar. This may take a few minutes.\n",
    "8. Eventually it will show a list of packages that would need to be installed. If everything looks ok to you, press the green \"Apply\" button in the \"Install Packages dialog box\" which will install the packages. This may take a few minutes too."
